    <p>Hey Darling,</p>
    How are you and how is your day going? I hope you know I love you and there
    is nothing in this world that can change that.In regards to how I reacted
    when you came back last night, I want to say I am sorry I overreacted
    without asking questions about what kept you out that late. I was worried as
    I couldn’t sleep and couldn’t reach through to you on your cell phone.I will
    make it up to you.
    <p>
      I have something waiting for you at our palace when you get back.I am glad
      you are in my life and I am grateful for that. Thank you, my Queen.
    </p>

  <div key={1}>
    <p>My heartbeat,</p>

    <p>
      I know you will be really busy at work but I thought I should take out
      some time to appreciate you.Seeing you this morning prepare the children
      for school, getting me ready for work and also getting ready for work made
      me realize that not all superheroes wear capes. Because I married one and
      she definitely doesn’t have a cape. It also made me realize that you are
      the best decision I ever made in my life.For being the most beautiful
      thing in my life, for always taking care of us even when you are
      overwhelmed with your office activities, for being the most caring,
      loving, passionate and selfless person I know, thank you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know I don’t tell you this often but I am the luckiest man in the world
      because I have you. You make this union easy even when we have our
      differences, you are always understanding. You are the perfect gift any
      man could ask for. I got you and that is all that matters. Making the
      ‘forever’ decision with you is the best decision I have ever made and for
      this, I am grateful to God for having you go on this journey with me. God
      bless you my love and enjoy the rest of your day. See you at home.

    <p>Hey Baby,</p>
    <p>
      I know you get stressed a lot and I was doing some search to get some
      quick tips on how you can feel better in a short while and not have to
      complain about being tired. So if you feel a little stressed and worried
      about anything or anyone, just bite the tip of your middle finger. Believe
      me, it works. According to thousands of years of hard work invested in
      research, it has been scientifically proven trick to help in stress/worry
      and anxiety management. The best part of it is that is it most effective
      especially for April fools around the world.You know I love you, baby.

    <p>My Forever,</p>
    <p>
      {"I'm "}lost and fading and I feel gloomy and low. Everywhere seems
      colourless and slow. The sky becomes darker even in the morning and at
      night I cannot find the moon rays dashing on me. Seeing your state right
      now in that hospital has been one of the hardest things I could ever do. I
      really wish I had not allowed you to go on that trip as I intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering the good old days alone is hard; seeing you lying on the bed
      in bad health is even harder. Come back to good health soon, love. Without
      you, this world seems hazy and not liable.I hope we get to reminisce about
      our sweet love memories together soon and get to make some new ones. I
      can’t bear this anymore. I need you here by my side. Get well soon, baby.

    <p>
      Following the recent event of my conduct at the pool party this last
      night, I can’t imagine being away from you even when we are in the same
      house, honey. A little part of me is already dying for hurting you. I
      should never have said those words to you. I cannot lose you, baby, as I
      promised to go on this journey with you forever the right way. The only
      thing I can do right now is to think about you. Seeing you like this
      shatters my heart. I can never forgive myself until you forgive me. Sorry
      for my misbehaviour.Can we please bury the hatchet and move on?
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise I will handle such situations wisely if it arises. I will never
      shout at you. Sorry, the love of my life!Sorry for breaking your heart
      baby. And I got you this gift to show you how really sorry I am.I’m sorry,
      my sweetheart. I love you.

    <p>Sugar,</p>
    <p>
      I can’t keep this feeling to myself anymore so I thought it wise to let
      you know. You are the only place I can call home. Amidst all the
      opposition from friends and family, I believe it will be right to say
      thank you for your love. I know I might be stubborn but even in my
      imperfections, weaknesses and flaws, you stood by me and never gave up on
      me. I just want you to know that I will never take your love for granted
      because your kind of love is rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirit soul and body continually long for you and I love you with all
      of me, with all that I have and with all that I am. I’m happy I’ve got you
      always.Yours’ TrulyWifey.

    <p>Dear Sunshine,</p>
    <p>
      I know this letter is coming as a shock to you at least you like surprises
      so you are allowed to be.However, this is real, real enough to know that
      {"it's"} been 10 years since we promised each other to do this forever and
      every day since then, your criticism means so much more to me than the
      admiration of many men. {'That’s'} a lie, and you know it! Meanwhile, life
      is too short to be in a long-lasting marriage and I have learned that
      marriage is a boxing ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you, partner, for smacking some sense into me. Assuming that God
      must have stuck some superglue between us on the day of your wedding
      because we seem so attached. Thank you for bringing light to my life and
      I’m so happy to have you. Happy anniversary wifey. With love,Hubby.
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div key={7}>
    <p>Dear Hubby,</p>
    <p>
      I know I have not been the best version of myself as I promised but I’m
      working on making it up to you. You have been very helpful in scrutinizing
      my decisions and most times the ones that will affect our family. The last
      couple of days have been full of regrets since I made such a decision
      without your counsel. I realized, although after the did have been done
      that It would have been a perfect idea to run the decision by you first
      but I didn’t. We are now in this mess all because of me. I’m sorry I let
      it get to this and I promise you my love that subsequently, I will not
      carry out any decision without seeking counsel from you first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have decided to trust your judgements and detects in delicate matters
      such as this and I will always stand by whatever you decide because I know
      it is for the benefit of our family.I send a sorry wish with gifts for my
      cute husband. And I hope you forgive me soon and will always treasure the
      love tokens I am sending you as gifts of our togetherness.Your Love,Wifey.

    <p>Hey Dear,</p>
    <p>
      I know this will come very strange to you as you know I don’t know how to
      work with letters but I figured this is truly the best way I could tell
      you how I feel.I know you are really angry with me right now and you have
      every reason to be. I realise it was unreasonable for me to react the way
      I did during the party. I was really tense at work and my boss was really
      getting on my nerves but it’s all been sorted now.You know that you are
      the most important person in my life, and I would never do anything to
      hurt you.My love, my dearest love.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      If you promise to forgive me just this one time, I promise not to make the
      same mistake again. I will always remember not to repeat this mistake; I
      might make other mistakes but not this one. I truly promise, pinky
      promise. I am very sorry for how I treated you in front of your friends
      and I regret every bit of that decision. I really hope you can forgive me
      because there is no one I’d rather be with. Look at me, I’m such a cute
      person. I will do anything to make you forgive me; just let me know what I
      can do.

  <div key={9}>
    <p>Hello baby,</p>
    <p>
      The thoughts of you were flowing through my mind and I thought it
      necessary to write to you this letter.I have come to realize that in this
      world of disbelief, you are the one I can trust and rely on. I don’t know
      what have I ever done to get you, but you make me want to be better To me,
      that is bigger than any love that has ever existed.Your gorgeous face,
      your kind heart, and your beautiful smile never fail to melt my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I keep falling more and more in love with you. You make falling in love a
      walk in the park because falling in love with you is like breathing, I do
      it without ever knowing. You are the best thing that ever happened to me.
      My life changed forever when you became part of it and I cannot help but
      start living the rest of my life with you,I am blessed to call you mine,
      love.

    <p>Hey Sweetheart,</p>
    <p>
      I’m writing this letter to let you in on something very important and I
      cannot wait until you are back to tell you. I know you said you are not
      ready for too many responsibilities as you have a lot on your plate. But
      then, I promise to help you eat whatever is leftover.You have always made
      sure to take care of me is the top priority. This last month was about the
      best month in our relationship; the dates, the surprises, the vacations
      and many more things I can’t even count and I promise I {"can't "}forget
      it in such a hurry I have something that has been bordering me for a while
      now, I have thought about it again and again. And I have also discussed it
      with a couple of friends from work and my mom and dad are quite aware of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m really tired of holding it back of course and I really think now is
      the right time to tell you about it. I’m pregnant. Now tell me, how’d you
      like to become a father on April 1st?
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div key={11}>
    <p>Hey Love,</p>
    <p>
      I thought about what conspired earlier today and I was so ashamed of what
      happened that I couldn’t bring myself to tell you how I feel in person so
      I thought I’d send a letter instead to express myself. It is easier this
      way for me.I notice that you were not in a perfect mood today. If my mean
      and rude words pushed you away, I hope my apology will bring you nearer to
      me. I am so sorry for hurting you.The truth is never in a million years
      can I find someone besides me like you. Letting you down cut my heart into
      pieces and regret and sorrow are eating them inside as I write this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am saying sorry because our relationship is far more important to me
      than anything else at this point in time. It does not really matter to me
      anymore who is right and who is wrong. I really hope you can feel
      it.Please accept my heartfelt apology and give me another chance. I
      promise I will make up for all the moments I have ruined before.Hope to
      hear from you soon.

    <p>Hey Mr Handsome,</p>
    <p>
      I {"don't "}listen to romantic love songs ever but I found myself
      listening to some romantic love songs last night, and all those reminded
      me of you. It is funny how when you are around, the very thought that
      covers my heart is a sense of being together even when we hug, I can feel
      peace when you hold my hand, I can feel the trust and when I think about
      cuddling with you, I can’t stop blushing. It is really hard not to think
      about but my lips whisper only your name every night in my sleep, my heart
      misses only you and my eyes keep searching the crowd only for you.Even
      doing silly things makes more sense meaning when I am with you; even a
      simple joke becomes funnier if you are around; your presence can turn bad
      things into good ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not certain about what life holds but whatever life will be, I want to
      be with you when it happens. And if it is smiling, we shout for joy as
      loudly as possible together and if it is painful, we hug each other. I
      have come to realise that happiness makes us feel good, but sadness does
      really bring us closer to each other. I like you a lot.
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div key={13}>
    <p>My Angel,</p>
    <p>
      I can’t stand the thought of you hating me and not wanting to see me
      again. It pains my heart so much that I realise this. I cannot begin to
      tell you how much I miss you and I really want to hear you say that
      everything will be fine. I’m sorry, baby. I know I have hurt you
      unimaginably this time, and your anger is justified. I deserve the silent
      treatment.Please I need you to know that you mean more than the world to
      me, and without you, my life feels like an empty case-useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I know that you love me too. You may be angry with me now, but I know
      that when the anger subsides, you will miss me. I really hope you’ll
      remember the deep love we share. I’m sorry.

    <p>Dear Honey,</p>
    <p>
      I don’t want the moon, I don’t want the world, I don’t want the skies, I
      just want you Because you have given me a reason to live, dream, and
      fight. Thank you for making my days worth living. Thank you for being the
      only person who understands me!I can’t stop loving you because it’s the
      only thing I’m good at and the only reason I was sent here on earth. Just
      to love you. Your presence in my life is a lifetime blessing which I don’t
      take for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re the gift that I never dared to ask for. The love you have given me
      is way beyond my imagination and truly my imaginations fail me.Sometimes
      it feels like I’m having a dream, but then I realize it’s all real and I’m
      the luckiest guy in this world. Just like a seed, my love will continue to
      grow for you and I thank god every day because he answered my prayer and
      gave me the most beautiful woman in the world.I can’t help myself from
      falling in love with you every day I can never get over it

  <div key={15}>
    <p>Hey Honey,</p>
    <p>
      I know you would be surprised to see that I’m sending you a letter even
      though I don’t really get to use it often. I thought I would give it a
      try.I got off the phone with your sister earlier today and she told me
      that you got the job and you didn’t even call or drop a message to let me
      in on this devastating turn of events- just kidding.You know the best
      thing about having an employed girlfriend, is that I don’t have to worry
      about the restaurant bills or a lot of bills anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t forget that having a new job is having some responsibilities too!May
      your office not get bored with you in the first week. Amen. Best wishes
      for your office. Ace it! I will see you when you get here
    </p>
  </div>,
  <div key={16}>
    <p>Hello Beautiful,</p>
    <p>
      I thought I would come to your house and talk to you later in the day, but
      I was afraid you might shut the door in my face after what happened, so
      I’ve decided to write to you a letter instead.I can’t express how much I
      regret my actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me, yet I took you for
      granted.I know I’ve hurt you. I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart. I
      shouldn’t have behaved the way I did. I want you to know that I love you
      and will do anything for you to forgive me and allow me back into your
      life.I miss you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m with you, I feel like I have lost sensations on my feet because I
      feel fly and sometimes I forget that I have what keeps my heart pumping; I
      think you stole my heart, took over my emotions, and made me insane. The
      cops are coming to arrest you.As I woke up this morning, the first thing
      that popped into me this morning was what we would do if you were still
      here. Maybe we will have some experiments in the kitchen with something
      fresh. And no, I’m not talking about food.Because of your presence in my
      life, all I have ever dreamt of have come true and without so much effort
      I feel I am where I belong-you.You know that those roses are red, and Sky
      is blue. But then you’re mine, and I love you.If you dream about me, I’ll
      also dream about you. Deal? I wish you were here to give me long hugs and
      kisses.

      I’m sorry I will be missing your mom’s 60th birthday because of work. I
      promise I am going to visit as soon as I am granted my annual leave. Don’t
      worry, I am sending a gift to one of the strongest women I know.I know I
      have not been around much to visit. The truth is that work has been really
      swamped up and I cannot stand to see my family lack anything that is why I
      am doing everything in my power to provide all and anything they may need
      as far as God still strengthens me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mom has always been there for my siblings and me even after my
      parent’s passed and I need you to know that even when I {"don't"} get to
      see you all often, I love you guys. She took us like her own tho we are
      barely related biologically. From dealing with our troubles and
      complaints, and even when we misbehave, you discipline us with
      unimaginable love, and pull us close even when it seems we {"don't"}{' '}
      deserve it. Not forgetting the guidance and counsel at every stage of my
      life even till now. Her wise words and directives have been a source of
      inspiration and strength. She is a perfect model of a mother and I am
      forever grateful to God for the gift of having her in my life.I pray for
      strength and more wisdom. God bless you and happy 60th mom. I love you.

      {"It's"} been 26 years since you saved me from those bullies. You did that
      even with your health challenges where everyone was just laughing at me.
      You are a blessing from the Almighty and I am forever thankful to Lord for
      blessing me with your presence in my life. It is amazing how you radiate
      such positive energy and warmth towards everyone not minding whether you
      know them or not. You make everyone around you feel at home and loved and
      you are a role model to a lot of youngsters in the neighbourhood.Even if
      {"it's"} been 26 years, our friendship is measured not by time, but by the
      strong bond we have.

      It is not easy to find a friendship that lasts for a lifetime, but you are

      I’m hoping you know you’re my best friend because you know 1001 ways to

      It is with deep regret that I am writing to you from a distance. I know
      you are angry with me and it is really eating me from the inside. I
      couldn’t bring myself to call ing you that is why I found it best to write
      this letter.At the point of receiving this, you must know just in case you
      {"haven't"} been told already that I moved out of the country. I’m sorry
      there was no time to inform you of my departure as the news came in even
      as a shock for me.

      Apparently, my parent has been planning it since and I {"didn't"} think it
      will be soon. My major regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye in
      person before leaving and I apologise for that. And I hope you know that
      under different circumstances, I would have informed you of my
      departure.However, I hope that one day I get to see you come over here.

    <p>
      Lately, I have been feeling some type of way when I see your calls, texts
      and a lot of other things has been reminding me of you and now I have been
      going through a very serious issue that at this point, I am not
      understanding. The most annoying thing is that I have been trying to get
      rid of it and it is not just working. It is that since you left my place
      with your brother a week ago, I can’t stop thinking about you! You are
      over my mind for every little moment and it is driving e crazy.Also not to
      forget that the last time I looked at my keyboard, I noticed that “u” and
      “i” are always together and you know, too much of anything is bad. You are
      so adorable and that is bad for me because I am badly falling in love with
      you.And now, I can’t concentrate when I’m trying to study… Grrr, hate you
      so much right now! See you when I see you!
