    'Hey Darling, How are you and how is your day going? I hope you know I love you and there is nothing in this world that can change that.In regards to how I reacted when you came back last night, I want to say I am sorry I overreacted without asking questions about what kept you out that late. I was worried as I couldn’t sleep and couldn’t reach through to you on your cell phone.I will make it up to you. I have something waiting for you at our palace when you get back.I am glad you are in my life and I am grateful for that. Thank you, my Queen.',
  
    'My heartbeat,I know you will be really busy at work but I thought I should take out some time to appreciate you.Seeing you this morning prepare the children for school, getting me ready for work and also getting ready for work made me realize that not all superheroes wear capes. Because I married one and she definitely doesn’t have a cape. It also made me realize that you are the best decision I ever made in my life.For being the most beautiful thing in my life, for always taking care of us even when you are overwhelmed with your office activities, for being the most caring, loving, passionate and selfless person I know, thank you. I know I don’t tell you this often but I am the luckiest man in the world because I have you. You make this union easy even when we have our differences, you are always understanding. You are the perfect gift any man could ask for. I got you and that is all that matters. Making the ‘forever’ decision with you is the best decision I have ever made and for this, I am grateful to God for having you go on this journey with me. God bless you my love and enjoy the rest of your day. See you at home.',

    'My Forever, I’m lost and fading and I feel gloomy and low. Everywhere seems colourless and slow. The sky becomes darker even in the morning and at night I cannot find the moon rays dashing on me. Seeing your state right now in that hospital has been one of the hardest things I could ever do. I really wish I had not allowed you to go on that trip as I intended. Remembering the good old days alone is hard; seeing you lying on the bed in bad health is even harder. Come back to good health soon, love. Without you, this world seems hazy and not liable.I hope we get to reminisce about our sweet love memories together soon and get to make some new ones. I can’t bear this anymore. I need you here by my side. Get well soon, baby.',
    'My Love, Following the recent event of my conduct at the pool party this last night, I can’t imagine being away from you even when we are in the same house, honey. A little part of me is already dying for hurting you. I should never have said those words to you. I cannot lose you, baby, as I promised to go on this journey with you forever the right way. The only thing I can do right now is to think about you. Seeing you like this shatters my heart. I can never forgive myself until you forgive me. Sorry for my misbehaviour.Can we please bury the hatchet and move on? I promise I will handle such situations wisely if it arises. I will never shout at you. Sorry, the love of my life!Sorry for breaking your heart baby. And I got you this gift to show you how really sorry I am.I’m sorry, my sweetheart. I love you.',
    'Sugar, I can’t keep this feeling to myself anymore so I thought it wise to let you know. You are the only place I can call home. Amidst all the opposition from friends and family, I believe it will be right to say thank you for your love. I know I might be stubborn but even in my imperfections, weaknesses and flaws, you stood by me and never gave up on me. I just want you to know that  I will never take your love for granted because your kind of love is rare. My spirit soul and body continually long for you and I love you with all of me, with all that I have and with all that I am. I’m happy I’ve got you always.Yours’ TrulyWifey.',
    "Dear Sunshine,I know this letter is coming as a shock to you at least you like surprises so you are allowed to be.However, this is real, real enough to know that it's been 10 years since we promised each other to do this forever and every day since then, your criticism means so much more to me than the admiration of many men. That’s a lie, and you know it! Meanwhile, life is too short to be in a long-lasting marriage and I have learned that marriage is a boxing ring. Thank you, partner, for smacking some sense into me. Assuming that God must have stuck some superglue between us on the day of your wedding because we seem so attached. Thank you for bringing light to my life and I’m so happy to have you. Happy anniversary wifey. With love,Hubby.",
  
    'Dear Hubby, I know I have not been the best version of myself as I promised but I’m working on making it up to you. You have been very helpful in scrutinizing my decisions and most times the ones that will affect our family. The last couple of days have been full of regrets since I made such a decision without your counsel. I realized, although after the did have been done that It would have been a perfect idea to run the decision by you first but I didn’t. We are now in this mess all because of me. I’m sorry I let it get to this and I promise you my love that subsequently, I will not carry out any decision without seeking counsel from you first. I have decided to trust your judgements and detects in delicate matters such as this and I will always stand by whatever you decide because I know it is for the benefit of our family.I send a sorry wish with gifts for my cute husband. And I hope you forgive me soon and will always treasure the love tokens I am sending you as gifts of our togetherness.Your Love,Wifey.',
    'Hey Dear,I know this will come very strange to you as you know I don’t know how to work with  letters but I figured this is truly the best way I could tell you how I feel.I know you are really angry with me right now and you have every reason to be. I realise it was unreasonable for me to react the way I did during the party. I was really tense at work and my boss was really getting on my nerves but it’s all been sorted now.You know that you are the most important person in my life, and I would never do anything to hurt you.My love, my dearest love. If you promise to forgive me just this one time, I promise not to make the same mistake again. I will always remember not to repeat this mistake; I might make other mistakes but not this one. I truly promise, pinky promise. I am very sorry for how I treated you in front of your friends and I regret every bit of that decision. I really hope you can forgive me because there is no one I’d rather be with. Look at me, I’m such a cute person. I will do anything to make you forgive me; just let me know what I can do.',
    'Hello baby, The thoughts of you were flowing through my mind and I thought it necessary to write to you this letter.I have come to realize that in this world of disbelief, you are the one I can trust and rely on. I don’t know what have I ever done to get you, but you make me want to be better To me, that is bigger than any love that has ever existed.Your gorgeous face, your kind heart, and your beautiful smile never fail to melt my heart. I keep falling more and more in love with you. You make falling in love a walk in the park because falling in love with you is like breathing, I do it without ever knowing. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. My life changed forever when you became part of it and I cannot help but start living the rest of my life with you,I am blessed to call you mine, love.',
    "Hey Sweetheart,I’m writing this letter to let you in on something very important and I cannot wait until you are back to tell you. I know you said you are not ready for too many responsibilities as you have a lot on your plate. But then, I promise to help you eat whatever is leftover.You have always made sure to take care of me is the top priority. This last month was about the best month in our relationship; the dates, the surprises, the vacations and many more things I can’t even count and I promise I can't forget it in such a hurry I have something that has been bordering me for a while now, I have thought about it again and again. And I have also discussed it with a couple of friends from work and my mom and dad are quite aware of it. I’m really tired of holding it back of course and I really think now is the right time to tell you about it. I’m pregnant. Now tell me, how’d you like to become a father on April 1st?",
    'Hey Love, I thought about what conspired earlier today and I was so ashamed of what happened that I couldn’t bring myself to tell you how I feel in person so I thought I’d send a letter instead to express myself. It is easier this way for me.I notice that you were not in a perfect mood today. If my mean and rude words pushed you away, I hope my apology will bring you nearer to me. I am so sorry for hurting you.The truth is never in a million years can I find someone besides me like you. Letting you down cut my heart into pieces and regret and sorrow are eating them inside as I write this. I am saying sorry because our relationship is far more important to me than anything else at this point in time. It does not really matter to me anymore who is right and who is wrong. I really hope you can feel it.Please accept my heartfelt apology and give me another chance. I promise I will make up for all the moments I have ruined before.Hope to hear from you soon.',
