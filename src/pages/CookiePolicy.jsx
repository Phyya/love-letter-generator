              or provided by third parties (ad networks; Google and Microsoft).
              When you have previously accepted cookies from these third
              parties, these third parties may use cookies alone or in
              conjunction with other tracking technologies to collect

              content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For
              information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted
              advertising or content from many providers, see below ‘Your online

              personalized. Ads are only based on the topic of the website you
              are looking at, your current search terms, or on your general
              location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing
              history. Your information can still be used to measure the
              effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.
