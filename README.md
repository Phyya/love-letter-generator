## Getting Started

- Prettier configured as pre-commit hook. For more on this visit [Prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)

### To run the ruby application follow the following simple steps

- clone the repo to local computer.

- git clone `https://github.com/workshopapps/loveletterwriter.web.git`

- From your terminal, navigate to project folder.

- change to `frontend` by `cd frontend`

- Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install all project dependencies

- Checkout into new git branch, `git checkout -b branch_name`

To Note: **_Remember to name branches either with your name or the component you are working on e.g. if you are working on Landing Page you can name your branch landing_page_component_**

- After doing your work stage all changes and commit your work.

- To push your work, make sure you are on your created branch and not the dev branch then run `git push -u origin branch_name`

- Visit the repository online and create a Pull Request from your current branch into `dev` branch.

- Once done, leave it at that and our FE lead or any assistants will merge them in a controlled manner to avoid git merge conflicts that may occur.
